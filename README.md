DC/OS test harness.


## Overview

*A shakedown is a period of testing or a trial journey undergone by a ship, aircraft or other craft and its crew before being declared operational.
    â€” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakedown_(testing)*


## Installation

Shakedown requires Python 3.6+.

### Installing from PyPI

The recommended Shakedown installation method is via the PyPI Python Package Index repository at [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dcos-shakedown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dcos-shakedown).  To install the latest version and all required modules:

`pip3 install dcos-shakedown`

dcos-shakedown has a number of dependencies which need to be available.  One of those dependencies, the cryptography module requires a number of OS level libraries in order to install correctly which include: `build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev`.  For environments other than linux please read [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22073516/failed-to-install-python-cryptography-package-with-pip-and-setup-py). On a new ubuntu environment the following should install dcos-shakedown.

* `apt-get update`
* `apt-get install python3 python3-pip build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev`
* `pip3 install dcos-shakedown`

### Development and bleeding edge

To pull and install from our `master` branch on GitHub:

```
